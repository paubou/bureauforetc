name: Barney Fagan
questions:
- Q1: "Graphic design, football and film enthusiast. I am lucky enough to be involved in two of them for a living and I spend most of my time using my practice and working hours either making content about or watching the third."
  Q2: "As a child I touched tips with a little wrinkly guy."
  Q3: "As a non-verbal communicator I could hopefully find a way to interact with the aliens beyond language. Iâ€™ve also seen enough films to hopefully know how most different forms of aliens would play out and what things worked out best for them. Football would probably be useless unless mediocre football knowledge or ability was of any clue or threat to them."
  Q4: "Get myself on tinder. Just start getting myself into as many strange, uncomfortable, potentially alien conversations I can."
  Q5: "A universally understood joke, like a fart."
