questions:
- Q1: "∅"
  Q2: "I feel Alien everyday, it’s all about the point of view. Anyway, I cultivate a “feeling of strangeness”.
  I believe in invisible strengths. Humans are obviously very anthropomorphic and consider the case of Alien forms with humour or a fictional point of view, but for me  it’s a serious question."
  Q3: "I hope, (but it’s perhaps pretentious!) my work could intrigue an Alien to ontologically ask the question “What is graphic design?”."
  Q4: "Having no “a priori” knowledge on how an Alien could look like, I would have difficulties preparing communication devices."
  Q5: "Maybe with colors, but could he see them? Nothing is less certain. "
