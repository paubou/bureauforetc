name: Francisco Ferreira
questions:
- Q1: "I’m a musician and a designer."
  Q2: "I’ve never had an interaction with extra terrestrial beings, but I’ve seen and known people that wouldn’t surprise me if they were. I also felt alienated, but I think that’s common to a lot of people."
  Q3: "I think my two best capacities and interests would be fulcral on a first contact. Sound and image are universal languages, unless the alien intelligence we’re dealing with isn’t physical or something like that. Even if we don’t know how to write or speak a language we don’t know, we can portray actions with noise and illustration."
  Q4: "Relaxing for a bit, maybe meditating? Lowering the ego and thinking of our littleness might also help."
  Q5: "If we had a way of communicating fluently I’d talk in a normal way, as if I was meeting a person. A “hey how’s it going” and then I’d go for more relevant questions. If we didn’t, I’d wave and do the peace sign like Ringo Starr."
