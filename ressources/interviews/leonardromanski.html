name: Leonard Romanski
questions:
- Q1: "I am currently hired as a design trainee generalist at a Berlin based studio, which basically means I am working as much as my coworkers, although I get less     bucks.
  But the trainee program also comes with less responsibility considering projects which, in most cases, is a good thing for a youngster.
 
  My various tasks include pushing pixels, coloring them, deleting them at a client’s finger flip, intense ping pong meetings and of course, conjuring a mean latte macchiato. 
 
  Hobbies are very much the same plus football, League of Legends (top lane) and minor client work."
  Q2: "Even though Berlin is a very colorful and often weird place to live in, I never had the pleasure to meet a life form from outer space (we call it Spandau) so far. Unfortunately, I never made it into the Berghain either, which is kind of our local Area 51.
 
  On the other hand, feeling alien is something everyone experiences on a regular basis I guess.
  For example a walk through a dark and misty neighbourhood with all the glow emitted from neon signs, traffic lights and distant sounds can lead to a very odd and extraneous state of mind. 
  A state of mind that I personally really admire most of the time."
  Q3: "Well, using my skills as a motion designer/animator, I could at least determine the superficial structure and physical nature of a life form by studying the way it bounces, jiggles, smears and walks. It could either be a metaball or a complex character rig.
 
  Also in case it is a another hoax from the US government, it would be easy for me to spot the most likely poor simulation and shading.
 
  If they can be defeated by either a loss in table tennis or hot latte macchiato then count on me, too."

  Q4: "Open my mind, empty my body, get a little medicated and probably try my best to not freak out completely. In all seriousness: no idea. 
 
  How do you prepare for something alien?"
  Q5: "I think Arrival got that covered quite nicely.
  Basically it would be key to ‘agree’ on a medium of communication: spoken or written language, signs, audio signals, light, radio waves or even a game.
 
  I’m not really sure if I’m physically and also mentally capable of starting an alien conversation though. It’s most likely incredibly challenging in many, many ways."
