name: Maria Manuel
questions:
- Q1: "I'm a director in an industrial company in the technical area, I coordinate a big group of people.
What I do relates essentially to that orchestration of my team: trying to make them reach interesting levels of creativity, inviting them to share common interests and objectives for the group."
  Q2: "I obviously have to be the alien in my group every day. It's my task to have a different vision. It's up to me too have extra-terrestrial abilities, which I don't possess, in the art of guiding said group with me. Understanding each individual and making sure they walk in the desired path without needing to take them by their hands, emerging everyone's talents that the group requires as one."
  Q3: "They couldn't, I don't know if I'd be able to read alien minds. I really like people; I like watching then, understanding them, I like to guess their decision processes and to influence them… at most, my curiosity and my observation ability could help decoding that which is perhaps seem as unintelligible… oh arrogance of those who ignore… how you often throw the helpless wearing these vests into danger!"
  Q4: "Don't communicate without first understanding!"
  Q5: "I'd call one such Enya with enchanting powers… and from there we'd study the power of wavy phenomena… it would be a conversation without words but with vibrations."
