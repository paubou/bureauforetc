questions:
- Q1: "Work and hobbies aren’t always the same… work is writing. But as I read, I’m also preparing for writing. And as I look and register, I’m also working."
  Q2: "No, unfortunately I didn’t. I think I’d like to. But I accept that they might come or that they might be around in a format that’s impossible for us to recognize."
  Q3: "I’d sit by a lake, and I’d read poems for the aliens. It’s all I can offer. Reading poetry for beings from other planets. After that it’s up to them to decide what to do with it."
  Q4: "Being open. Not thinking they come to attack us. Trying to dance with the alien. Or if possible, making love."
  Q5: "“Do you know what a poem is? Are there poets in your land…?”"
